# Question 1:
############
You have been given a three-node cluster. Within that cluster, you must deploy your application and then successfully update the application to a new version without causing any downtime. You will use the image linuxacademycontent/kubeserve:v1, which will serve as your application. You must perform the steps to verify your app successfully rolled out initially; create a service for your deployment, so it can be used by the end user; and then perform the update, verifying that the update did not experience any service interruption for your end users. You must perform the following tasks in order to complete this hands-on lab:

Create and roll out a deployment, and verify the deployment was successful.
Verify the application is using the correct version.
Scale up your application to create high availability.
Create a service from your deployment, so users can access your application.
Perform a rolling update to version 2 of the application.
Verify the app is now at version 2 and there was no downtime to end users.
